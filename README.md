# PicoTelegraphSounder
Raspberry Pi Pico translating text file into morse and tapping out on a telegraph sounder

The program includes Lincoln's Gettysburg Address as gettysburg.txt.  One button with start the program translating the file and a second will break.  
If you don't have a sounder, replace it with an LED and this will blink out the Gettysburg Address for you.
